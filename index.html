      <h1>Who am I ?</h1>
      <p>A curious little porker with a big dream and even bigger glasses. While most pigs are happy rolling in the mud, I roll up my sleeves and dive into lines of code.</p>

    <div class="title">
      <h1>How did I get here?</h1>
      <p>I wasn’t born in Silicon Valley — I was raised in a small pen on a farm, surrounded by haystacks and hacking thoughts. I discovered my passion for coding the day I accidentally stepped on a keyboard and saw colors move on the screen. Since then, there’s been no turning back.</p>

      <h1>What do I do ?</h1>
      <p>I may not have thumbs, but I’ve mastered web development. I build websites, solve problems, and believe that great ideas can come from the unlikeliest of places</p>
